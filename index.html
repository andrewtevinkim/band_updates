<p>Is electric guitar attractive? Well, maybe if you get really focused.</p>

<p>If the album is called Music and Language, what if people like it? Well, it would be a terrific outcome. Surely, this is the first priority. Whether or not music has to do with art or artists, you take the music itself and you try to somehow get people to like it. You either write without much sense, or you try to adjust the music toward a level which is considered to be good. If people really want, I could always simply make more music.</p>

<p>Clean is shiny. It has a long history. You can probably say that it is taught in schools. It talks well. It tries to have a good visual appeal. It sounds like it might have origins from a long time ago. Clean is a good thing, and many things are clean.</p>

<p>The music business is interesting, what drives the music business is interesting, signings are interesting. Music is so interesting that you can phone it. Music is so interesting that there are ways of recording and storing it. It's so interesting that no one really wants to talk about it.</p>
