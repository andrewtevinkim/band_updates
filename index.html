<p>Clean is shiny. It has a long history. You can probably say that it is taught in schools. It talks well. It tries to have a good visual appeal. It sounds like it might have origins from a long time ago. Clean is a good thing, and many things are clean.</p>

<p>The music business is interesting, what drives the music business is interesting, signings are interesting. Music is so interesting that you can phone it. Music is so interesting that there are ways of recording and storing it. It's so interesting that no one really wants to talk about it.</p>
